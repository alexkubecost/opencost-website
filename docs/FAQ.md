# FAQ

### What is OpenCost?

OpenCost is a vendor-neutral open source project for measuring and allocating infrastructure and container costs in Kubernetes environments.

The project combines the Kubecost core allocation engine with a new community-driven [spec](https://github.com/kubecost/opencost/tree/develop/spec) on how to monitor costs in Kubernetes land. The allocation engine is a Golang implementation that conforms to spec. Both have now been submitted to the CNCF.

### How do I get started with the project?

You can [install](https://docs.kubecost.com/install) the project in minutes. Come join the [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/kubecost/shared_invite/enQtNTA2MjQ1NDUyODE5LWFjYzIzNWE4MDkzMmUyZGU4NjkwMzMyMjIyM2E0NGNmYjExZjBiNjk1YzY5ZDI0ZTNhZDg4NjlkMGRkYzFlZTU) community if you have more questions, have input, or want to get involved in other ways.
